## Features

* **Extensive Product Search Capabilities:** Quickly find food items by **barcode** or **product name** using the Open Food Facts API. 
* **Intelligent Recipe Generation:** Leveraging the Google Gemini AI, Savor generates unique, healthy, and easy-to-follow recipes based on the exact ingredients in your pantry.
* **Asynchronous Task Management:** Recipe generation is handled in the background by **Celery workers**. This ensures the application remains fast and responsive, preventing long loading times while the AI processes requests.
* **Dynamic Pantry Synchronization:** A smart system of middleware and signals ensures your recipe suggestions are always up-to-date. Recipes are automatically regenerated when a user:
    * Logs in or starts a new session.
    * Adds or removes an item from their pantry.
* **Local Data Caching:** Efficiently stores product details in a local database and a Redis cache to speed up subsequent searches and reduce external API calls.
* **API Rate Limit Adherence:** Implements server-side rate limiting to ensure the controlled consumption of external APIs.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear and informative error responses for various scenarios, including network issues, API errors, and rate limit excursions.
* **Secure User Authentication:** Features secure user registration, login, and logout to enable personalized pantry management.
